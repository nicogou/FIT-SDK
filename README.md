# Custom FIT SDK

This is a custom version of the FIT SDK, tailored for my [LSM6DSV16X evaluation project](https://github.com/nicogou/xiao-ble-lsm6dsv16x)

See https://developer.garmin.com/fit/cookbook/fitgen/, paragraph "Optimizing the FIT C SDK" for details on how to optimize the SDK for embedded C.
